I recently had an interview test where the final coding challenge was to retrieve json data from rest endpoint based on some various parameters.

Challenges encountered:

  1) I had only used python once to retrieve json data (and was expecting to be able to use GOLang - though go is arguably more time consuming for the task)
  2) I had never worked on paginated rest data

Although I knew what I needed to do conceptually, I did not perform in the time alloted.

Lesson learned: 

  * Be specific about your proficiency and how you've used a language on your resume.

Having never delt with pagination at all, I wanted to concentrate on page changes and retrieval of various data
from a rest api returning json for each resource item in python.

This function just counts total female and male characters but the structure could be used to do more complex queries 
although refactoring for speed may be necessary.
